# HD Texture Pack with AI Upscaling for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind.
This is a high-resolution texture pack for the PS2 game "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind".
Make sure your game's serial number is "SLPM-65140" and the CRC is "0745318F" for it to work perfectly.

# How to install, activate and configure:
Installation and Download:
Download the file from the following link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/eyn4c9v49s1li8v/SLPM-65140.7z/file.
This texture pack is for the PCSX2 emulator and its version. To install this texture pack, extract the files and move the "SLPM-65140" folder to the folder where you normally store the textures you use in the emulator, by default it is "textures". Activation:
To activate textures, in your emulator, right-click and select "Properties". Check if the "Serial Number" and "CRC" are compatible with your game version (Japanese). Then, go to "Graphics" and then to "Texture Replacement". Make sure to enable the "Load textures" and "Asynchronous texture loading" or "Pre-load textures" options (according to your preference). The textures should be activated immediately after this.

Improvements:
For a better experience:
"Rendering" --> "Bilinear Texture Filtering" --> "PS2 Bilinear" (filters the texture, making it smoother),
"Rendering" --> "Dithering" --> "Force 32-bit" (uses 32-bit colors in textures).

Optional enhancements (that I use):
"Post-processing" --> "Adaptive sharpness adjustment by contrast" --> "Sharpness and resizing",
"Post-processing" --> "Sharpness" --> "50%",
"Post-processing" --> "FXAA" --> "Enabled"
"Post-processing" --> "Tone boost" --> "On",
"Post-processing" --> "Brightness" --> "57%",
"Post-processing" --> "Gamma" --> "50%",
"Post-processing" --> "Contrast" --> "60%",
"Post-processing" --> "Saturation" --> "65%".
