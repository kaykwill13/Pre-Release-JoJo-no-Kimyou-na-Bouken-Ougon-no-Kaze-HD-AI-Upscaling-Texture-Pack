Installation and Download:
This texture pack is for the PCSX2 emulator and version. To install this texture pack, download the contents, extract them, and move the "SLPM-65140" folder to the folder where you normally store the textures you use in the emulator, which in this case is "textures".

Activation:
To activate the textures, in your emulator, right-click and select "Properties," check if the "Serial" and "CRC" are compatible with your game version (Japanese). Then, go to "Graphics," "Texture Replacement." Make sure to enable the options "Load textures" and "Asynchronous texture loading" or "Texture pre-caching" (your preference). The textures should be active immediately after this.

Improvements:

For a better experience:

"Rendering" --> "Bilinear Texture Filtering" --> "PS2 Bilinear" (filter the texture, making it smoother),

"Rendering" --> "Dithering" --> "Force 32-bit" (use of 32-bit color in textures).

Optional enhancements (that I use):
"Post-processing" --> "Adaptive sharpness adjustment by contrast" --> "Sharpness and resizing",
"Post-processing" --> "Sharpness" --> "50%",
"Post-processing" --> "FXAA" --> "Enabled"
"Post-processing" --> "Tone boost" --> "On",
"Post-processing" --> "Brightness" --> "57%",
"Post-processing" --> "Gamma" --> "50%",
"Post-processing" --> "Contrast" --> "60%",
"Post-processing" --> "Saturation" --> "65%".
